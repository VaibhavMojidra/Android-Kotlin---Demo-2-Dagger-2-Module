# Android Kotlin Demo 2 Dagger 2 Module

Dagger 2 is a popular dependency injection framework for Java and Android applications. It provides a way to define and manage dependencies in your application by generating the boilerplate code for dependency injection.

In Dagger 2, a module is a class annotated with @Module that provides a set of dependencies to the dependency injection framework. Modules define methods annotated with @Provides to specify how to create instances of certain classes or interfaces.
